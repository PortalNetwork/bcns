## 📝 Description

BCNS is the Bitcoin Cash Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
BCNS eliminates the need to copy or type long addresses. With BNS, you'll be able to send token to anyone at 'yourfriend.bch' instead of 'qrd9khmeg4nqag3h5gzu8vjt537pm7le8...', interact with your favorite contract at 'mycontract.bch', or visit an IPFS-hosted site at 'mywebsite.bch’.

## Technical Overview

BNS is a portable Omni Layer implementation that is based on the Bitcoin ABC codebase. This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Bitcoin ABC, and is native to the Bitcoin Cash network just like other Bitcoin Cash nodes. BNS Layer extensions are exposed via the JSON-RPC interface.
