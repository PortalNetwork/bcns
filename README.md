## üí° What is Bitcoin Cash?
Bitcoin Cash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.

## üí° What is BNS?
BNS ‚Äì or blockchain name system ‚Äì is the protocol on the internet that turns human-comprehensible decentralized website names such as ‚Äòwebsite.bch or ‚Äòmywebsite.eth‚Äô into addresses understandable by decentralized network machines.

## üìù Description

BCNS is the Bitcoin Cash Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
BCNS eliminates the need to copy or type long addresses. With BNS, you'll be able to send token to anyone at 'yourfriend.bch' instead of 'qrd9khmeg4nqag3h5gzu8vjt537pm7le8...', interact with your favorite contract at 'mycontract.bch', or visit an IPFS-hosted site at 'mywebsite.bch‚Äô.

## Technical Overview

BNS is a portable Omni Layer implementation that is based on the Bitcoin ABC codebase. This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Bitcoin ABC, and is native to the Bitcoin Cash network just like other Bitcoin Cash nodes. BNS Layer extensions are exposed via the JSON-RPC interface.
