## 📝 Description

BCNS is the Bitcoin Cash Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
BCNS eliminates the need to copy or type long addresses. With BNS, you'll be able to send token to anyone at 'yourfriend.bch' instead of 'qrd9khmeg4nqag3h5gzu8vjt537pm7le8...', interact with your favorite contract at 'mycontract.bch', or visit an IPFS-hosted site at 'mywebsite.bch’.
