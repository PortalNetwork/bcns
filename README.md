## üí° What is Bitcoin Cash?
Bitcoin Cash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.

## üí° What is BNS?
BNS ‚Äì or blockchain name system ‚Äì is the protocol on the internet that turns human-comprehensible decentralized website names such as ‚Äòwebsite.bch or ‚Äòmywebsite.eth‚Äô into addresses understandable by decentralized network machines.

## üìù Description

BCNS is the Bitcoin Cash Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
BCNS eliminates the need to copy or type long addresses. With BNS, you'll be able to send token to anyone at 'yourfriend.bch' instead of 'qrd9khmeg4nqag3h5gzu8vjt537pm7le8...', interact with your favorite contract at 'mycontract.bch', or visit an IPFS-hosted site at 'mywebsite.bch‚Äô.

## üìñ Technical Overview

BNS is a portable Omni Layer implementation that is based on the Bitcoin ABC codebase. This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Bitcoin ABC, and is native to the Bitcoin Cash network just like other Bitcoin Cash nodes. BNS Layer extensions are exposed via the JSON-RPC interface.

## üìö BCNS Spec

### Transaction Field Definitions

This section defines the fields that are used to construct transaction messages.

#### Field: Ecosystem
- Description: Specifies the ecosystem of BCNS
- Size: 8-bit unsigned integer, 1 byte
- Valid values: 1

#### Field: Integer-one byte
- Description: used as a multiplier or in other calculations
- Size: 8-bit unsigned integer, 1 byte
- Valid values: 0 to 255

#### Field: UTC Datetime
- Description: Datetime, assuming UTC timezone (the same timezone used by the bitcoin blockchain)
- Size: 64-bits standard unix timestamp, 8 bytes (note: seconds, not milliseconds)

#### Field: Property type
- Description: Specifies the type of BCNS.
- Size: 8-bit unsigned integer, 1 byte
- Valid values:
    - 1: Domain name is available
    - 3: Domain name is taken and currently owned by someone
    - 4: Domain name is forbidden

#### Field: Bitcoin Address
- Description: the 21 bytes needed to uniquely identify a bitcoin address
- Size: 21 bytes, binary data
- Valid values: any 21 bytes (version + output of RIPEMD-160 hash step of creating a bitcoin address)

#### Field: Transaction version
- Description: Description: the version of the transaction definition, monotonically increasing independently for each transaction type
- Size: 16-bit unsigned integer, 2 bytes
- Required/optional: Required
- Valid values: 0 to 65535

#### Field: Transaction type
- Description: the MSC Protocol function to be performed
- Size: 16-bit unsigned integer, 2 bytes
- Current Valid values:
    - 0: Register a domain
    - 30: Set domain owner
    - 31: Create BCNS subdomain
    - 32: Set domain resolver
    - 33: Set domain time to leave
    - 50: Set address associate with domain
    - 51: Set content associate with domain
    - 52: Set multihash associate with domain
    - 53: Set name associate with domain
    - 54: Set text associate with domain(key-value pair)

## What is Omni Layer?
Omni Layer is a communication protocol that uses Bitcoin blockchain to implement smart contracts. Omni Core is a fast, portable Omni layer implementation based on the Bitcoin core code base. Omni Layer does not require external dependencies that are not related to Bitcoin Core, and like other Bitcoin nodes, it is itself a bitcoin network. The Omni Layer extension is exposed through the JSON-RPC interface.

### Dependency

Library     | Purpose          | Description
------------|------------------|--------------------
libssl      | Crypto           | Random number generation, encrypt by Elliptic curve cryptography 
libboost    | Utility          | Thread, data structure
libevent    | Networking       | Independent network of the operating system
miniupnpc   | UPnP Support     | Across the firewall
libdb4.8    | Berkeley DB      | Storage (only needed when wallet enabled)
qt          | GUI              | GUI toolkit (only needed when GUI enabled)
protobuf    | Payments in GUI  | Data exchange format in payment protocol (only needed when GUI enabled)
libqrencode | QR codes in GUI  | Generate QR code (only required when GUI enabled)
univalue    | Utility          | JSON parsing and generation (bundled version will be used unless ‚Äìwith-system-univalue passed to configure)
libzmq3     | ZMQ notification | Generate zmq messages (ZMQ, ZeroMQ, message queue)

#### Memory requirement
The C++ compiler consumes more memory, and the official recommendation is to have at least 1.5GB of memory when compiling Bitcoin Core.

```
./configure CXXFLAGS="--param ggc-min-expand=1 --param ggc-min-heapsize=32768"
```

### Install 

Since we need to use `apt` installation, first make sure apt source is available
```
sudo apt-get update
```
![Omni Step 1](../assets/omni1.png)

#### Install basic environment
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils
```
![Omni Step 2](../assets/omni2.png)

#### Install boost library
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev
```
![Omni Step 3](../assets/omni3.png)

#### Install BerkeleyDB 
Bitcoin requires BerkeleyDB 4.8 to maintain wallet compatibility. The official Ubuntu and Debian Berkeley DB is 5.1+. This high version is determined to break its compatibility.
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
```
![Omni Step 4](../assets/omni4.png)

#### Install GUI dependency

If you need to compile `bitcoin-qt`, you need to install qt development environment, qt4 and qt5 are all possible. If both are installed, qt5 is used by default. You can also use `--with-gui=qt4` during configuration. Choose to use the qt4 version, or use `--without-gui` to choose not to compile the gui.
```
sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```

#### Compile
```
git clone https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore.git
cd omnicore/
./autogen.sh
./configure
./configure CXXFLAGS="--param ggc-min-expand=1 --param ggc-min-heapsize=32768" # optional
make
```
